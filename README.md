# ASE285-ChatGPTClone

## Project Description

An AI chatbot that the user can talk with and can have multiple sessions.

## Problem Domain

Research and learning can be difficult to find and parse on your own. Information can be spread far on the internet, or worded poorly making research and learning much harder than it needs to be. With an AI companion, this process can be streamlined and if there is any confusion the companion is there to help clear it up.
